Electronic business is the online business opposite to the traditional business which only can do the business in the physical store. For example, the clothing company wants to “expand” their business with an online store, so it builds a website for the customers to place an order, and the clothes will be shipped to their home. On the other hand, the electronic commerce is an online “platform” that the users can sell and buy the thing on the Internet, such as Amazon. Amazon only provides a platform for their users to exchange the value, but not like the online clothing store, customers would not buy the product which made by Amazon directly.</p></body></html>
